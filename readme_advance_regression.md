## General Information
- The project aims to predict house prices based on various features.
- The business problem is to assist homebuyers and sellers in estimating house prices more accurately.
- The dataset includes information such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and overall house quality.

## Conclusions
- The quality of the house (`OverallQual`), living area (`GrLivArea`), and garage size (`GarageCars`) are significant predictors of house prices.
- The project utilizes Ridge and Lasso Regression for feature selection and regularization.
- Cross-validation and model evaluation metrics provide insights into the model's performance.
